Summary
=======

My approach to this problem was to start small and keep chipping away at ways I could improve it. I started with lots of conditionals within one function and then began to nest those groupings into their own functions. This taught me a lot about working with scope as well as accessing functions within other functions (a powerful thing!). In terms of scope I was unable to figure out why some functions ie. getStandardPrice() would not accept certain parameters ie. basePrice. When I passed it in as a parameter the value became undefined within the function but without passing it in as a parameter the value remained in tact. I would love to learn why this is.

I also tried my hand at writing exceptions to account for user errors in the program, namely invalid inputs. I was interested to learn about try/catch method that allows the program to continue running despite other throw errors and making the error known when the program as a whole fails. I was working on a test for this throwError but I can't yet make it pass.

Overall this was a fun challenge that gave me the opportunity to explore some ideas a bit more in depth. I can't wait to learn more.
