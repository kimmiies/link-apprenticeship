First Iteration
===============

Start simple and write a program that works. Using one function and conditional statements to determine the cost of a project given three inputs (base price, number of people required for job and the item category).

Set up test framework Jasmine that tests the program outputs based on the three examples given in the program.

Thinking about:
- Where and how to validation inputs. In the program or in the test specs?
- Functional programming vs OOP
- Writing more meaningful tests
